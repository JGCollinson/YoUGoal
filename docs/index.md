## Deliverables

- *Deliverable 1*
  - Create a file called `index.md` in your `docs` folder at the root of your project.
  - Using markup, write to your `index.md` file the following:
    - Overview of the intended application, and why you feel it's valuable.

    YoUGoal is a soccer player and team rating app toolkit used to look through and rate different famous and important soccer players and teams from around the world. Users will rate individual players and team in comparison to the current EA Sports FIFA ratings of the players and teams.  The FIFA video game community is only growing and this site aims to give the FIFA player community a way to conveniently give EA feedback on their game rankings.

    - A breakdown of roles by group member.
    - A schedule for completion of various tasks.
    - A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule.
    - A set of DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen.
  - Add the `docs` folder and file(s) to your repo, and push it to the GitHub repository you will use for your final project.
  - Set up GitHub pages to publish this documentation [like this](https://blog.github.com/2016-08-22-publish-your-project-documentation-with-github-pages/)

You may also put these requirements in separate markdown files and link to them, if you so choose.

- *Deliverable 2*
  - Add another screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule to your `docs` markdown file. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.
  - You should also have a link to your MVP project on Heroku listed somewhere in your repository.  Probably best if you add it to the Description at the top of the repo page on GitHub.

    - A summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.
    - A detailed description of each person's contributions.
    - A detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:
      - Stretch Features
      - Bugs
      - Enhancements
      - UI Polishing

- *Deliverable 4*
  - Update your `README.md` to describe your project, how to run it, protocol for making changes, deployment links, etc, prior to presentation day.
